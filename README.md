# MailUp: A Chat-Style Desktop Mail Client

## ðŸ’¡ Idea

MailUp reimagines email as a chat experience. Instead of traditional inboxes and threads, each email conversation appears like a messaging appâ€”with chat bubbles, a sidebar for conversations, and a reply box at the bottom. The goal is to make email feel as fast, intuitive, and modern as chat, while supporting all the power of traditional email.

- **Chat-style UI:** See your emails as chat bubbles in a conversation.
- **Unified conversations:** Sidebar lists all your email threads, just like chats.
- **Rich replies:** Compose responses with formatting and attachments in a familiar chat interface.
- **System integration:** Native notifications, tray icon, and drag-and-drop attachments for a seamless desktop experience.

## ðŸ”® Future Plans

- **Unified inbox:** Manage multiple accounts in one place.
- **AI-powered features:** Summarize long emails, suggest smart replies, and more.
- **Collaboration:** Shared inboxes and real-time collaboration on emails.
- **Offline-first:** Access and compose emails even without an internet connection.
- **End-to-end encryption:** Ensure privacy and security for sensitive conversations.

MailUp aims to bring the best of chat and email together for a faster,
